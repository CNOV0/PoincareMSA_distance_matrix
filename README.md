PoincareMSA builds a projection of protein multiple sequence alignemnt on a Poincaré disk.

### Prerequisits
PoincareMSA relies on hyperbolic projections build as described in the original paper. 

One can use a conda environment to access all the cenessary libraries:
```
conda env create -f env_poincare.yml
conda activate env_poincare
```

### Data preparation

### Poincaré projection implementation

### Visulaisation

### Examples of use
We provide several examples of PoincareMSA usage for different protien families in the `examples` folder. Each example comes with a bash script alloqing to reproduce the results starting from MSA and labels contained in `data`.
